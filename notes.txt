This program began for Control-Tec as a program to move files quickly between directories.
I now want this program to replace cp/mv as part of a new package as a fast-copy utility

TODO: 
Add multi-threading back in to the program
add flags and nice help message for user
--- flags should be for copy vs move distinction
remove loop to stall completion if less than 24 files
