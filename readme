This program started as a program to move files between directories for a kind of chroot jail. 
Now, It aims to be a fast, multi-threaded tool to copy and move files with no upper limit of file size and number of files

That being said, I have no idea how far along this project is, but I'd like to pursue it in my free time, and I'm hoping putting it
on GitHub will help me with that.
